# ![RealWorld Example App](http://slimjs.com/ae609b6edbf39d3ccf48178b07c38443.png =124x124) Realworld example app

> ### slim.js codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **slim.js** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **slim.js** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> This app is based on the robust slim.js library.
> It is bundled with webpack because of the use of decorators.
> Slim.js applications can be delivered without any bundling or utilities, check out the [documentation](http://slimjs.com)

# Getting started

> `npm install` then `npm start`
